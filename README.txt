I just create the map camera, de two cameras showing the panoramic view, 
and finally another camera as a texture of an object from other point of view.

I see that when I open the project in Unity, as a new project, the display 2 screen,
is not plotted by default, so I think that you have to create a new Game Tab, and then asign to these 
tab de display 2. Then when you press play, you will see all the cameras and also the panoramic.
